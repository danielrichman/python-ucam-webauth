these use the settings of the Raven Demo Server,
`<http://raven.cam.ac.uk/project/test-demo/>`_

.. data:: PUBKEY901

    The key used to verify responses, from
    `<https://raven.cam.ac.uk/project/keys/demo_server/>`_

.. data:: RAVEN_DEMO_AUTH

    The WLS' authentication start page:
    ``RAVEN_DEMO_AUTH.format(quoted_query_string)`` will produce a request

.. data:: RAVEN_DEMO_LOGOUT

    The WLS' logout page: redirecting to this URL will log the user out of
    Raven completely.
